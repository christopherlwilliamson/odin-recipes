    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is the classic that is so popular in Chinese restaurants.
         Banana sauce can be found in Asian stores. It is made in the Philippines. If you can't get it substitute ketchup. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups peanut oil for frying </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil </li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch </li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces </li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons rice vinegar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon banana ketchup </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil </li>
        <li>6 dried whole red chilies </li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange zest </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 4 cups of peanut oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and the cornstarch. Mix in the chicken until all the pieces are coated with batter.
             Drop into the hot oil a piece at a time; cook until the chicken is golden brown on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, about 4 minutes. 
             Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Stir together the vinegar, wine, sugar, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and the banana ketchup in a small bowl until smooth; set aside. 
            Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the dried chile peppers and cook for a few seconds until the peppers brighten.
             Stir in the onion, garlic, and orange zest. Cook and stir until the onion is beginning to brown. Stir in the sauce; bring to a boil before adding the fried 
             chicken. Reduce the heat to medium and stir until the chicken pieces are well coated with the sauce, a few minutes longer. Serve sprinkled with green onions
              and toasted sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
